# Bayesian-Networks-simulation

This is a small simulation on two methods for probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks for my final paper in the Bachelor of Science in Mathematical and Computing Sciences for Artificial Intelligence at Bocconi University. The simulation was done using R, and is divided in two scripts. The algorithms that I simulated are the clique tree algorithm for exact inference and the likelihood weighting algorithm for approximate inference. The main package that I used is 'bnlearn', while the dataset that I used is about the Asia network. The code is very basic, as it was not the main part of the thesis, which covered a vast range of theoretical aspects regarding Bayesian networks.
